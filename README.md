# Relevant-tag-extraction
I have used "tagger" (forked from  https://github.com/kevinmcmahon/tagger) for extracting relevant tags from text.

Usage:

Enter the text: Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it.

Expected Output:

['machine learning', 'human genome', 'dozens', 'self-driving cars', 'science', 'introduce automation', 'effective web search', 'practical speech recognition', 'explicitly programmed', 'vastly improved understanding']
